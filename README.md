# AJAX Is Scary, and Other Fun Too

## AJAX

Now that we're experts on AJAX, let's take another stab at last night's AJAX homework. 

If you didn't complete it, get to all the steps! If you did complete it, take a moment to review it, and try to understand why it was organized the way it was.

## Submission

You can work in your U02D01 branch instead of creating a new branch. When you git add, git commit, and git push your changes, it should update your pull request automatically with the latest code. Be sure to leave a new comment on the pull request reflecting your new completion, comfortability, etc.

If you had already gotten to all the required steps, be sure to review anything you weren't comfortable with, and leave a comment on the pull request about what you reviewed and why it makes more sense now.

Another thing people may already have: personal portfolio websites!

Create a new repo and link it to a folder OUTSIDE of any existing git folders (e.g. WDI Purple Rain, Project 1).

What does your personal portfolio need to have?
* A photo of you - doesn't need to be super professional, there should be opportunities moving forward to get better headshots or photos of yourself
* A short blurb about yourself - you're a web developer now, but what else are you? What makes you unique?
* Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, other professional websites you may want linked
* A section for web dev projects - each project should have an image of the project, a short description about what it does and what technologies it uses, and a link to the actual project. Do this even if you only have one project or if you're not super ok with making this project publically available - you'll constantly be updating this portfolio with new projects and tricks, so this will just serve as a backbone for later
* Responsiveness! It should look decent on your phone and on the web. Consider putting the below line of code into the HTML head. What do you think it does?
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
* Deploy to gh-pages!
* Give it your own personal style!

If you already have a personal portfolio:  
* Make sure it hits those requirements! 
* Make sure you're building your own portfolio from scratch (don't use squarespace or another provider)

## Submission

After you have a portfolio page that meets all the criteria, slack me the deployed portfolio and the github repo.
